1-player Game

2. Press any key to START. The game will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color lens.

3. Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.

4. Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of flickrs correctly. 
If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, or if you take more than 5 seconds to repeat a signal, the game responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.
